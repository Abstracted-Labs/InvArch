# IP Replicas Pallet: Intellectual Property Replicas (IPRs) Pallet

This is a Substrate [Pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) that defines the instances where, just like forking a repository of code, it is convenient to produce a noted, tracked, & authorized copy of a natively-interoperable IP File or an NFT featuring a standard that is interoperable & composable with the INV4 protocol.
