# IP Bonding Pallet: Intellectual Property Bonding (Bonded IP) Pallet

This is a Substrate [Pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) that defines the bond of two or more IP Files when they are locked together to join relation while remining distinct in their composition & independent in their functioning. This would be noted in the metadata of the cross-chain markup language (XCML) indexing of two assets, tied by their IPF IDs.
