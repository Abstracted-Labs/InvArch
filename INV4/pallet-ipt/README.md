# IPT Pallet: IP Tokens for Substrate

This is a Substrate [Pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/pallets) that defines basic functions
to create and manage Intellect Property Tokens (IPT), which are fungible assets pegged to a non-fungible asset called 
an Intellectual Property Set (IPS). IPT can feature SubAssets, which are multiple layers of fungible assets pegged to a
single IPS.
