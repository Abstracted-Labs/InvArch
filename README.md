## Overview

InvArch is short for the "Invention, Involvement, & Investment Arch" platform.

The focus of the InvArch project is to develop a platform where individuals can mint & store their ideas and concepts for innovations as NFTs called
intellectual property tokens (IPTs). 

Users can form partnerships, call decentralized entrepreneurial ventures (DEVs), between the author of an IPT and 
users whoo have the skills and/or resources to actualize the idea. 

DEVs are formed by leveraging fractional & fungible ownership tokens that are pegged to an IPT and built into the DEV. IPTO can also be used 
in exchange for startup capital, and provides governance participation in a DEV. 

When a DEV is complete, which is determined through the consensus of a DEV's governing community, its related IPTO is liquidated at a proportionate
ratio to either cryptocurrency tokens or company shares. 🚀


## Features

### Intellectual Property Tokens (IPTs)

⚙️  Multi-layer IPTs: an IPT can own and inherit the metadata of another IPT.

⚙️  Multi-attribute IPTs: code, diagrams, 3D models, images, and other docs can be stored within the metadate of an IPT.

### Decentralized Entrepreneurial Ventures (DEVs)

⚙️  IPTs Governed as DAOs: Pegged & fungible IPT Ownership (IPTO) allow decentralized governance of the development of an IPT.

⚙️  Professional Networking: IPTO is leveraged to form partnerships with individuals with the skills and/or resources to actualize.

### IPT Ownership (IPTO)

⚙️  IPT Ownership: Fractional ownership tokens are minted in quantities of 10k, each representing a 0.01% stake over a DEV.

⚙️  Leveraging IPTO: IPTO can be leveraged in exchange for not just skills (i.e. partnerships), but also in exchange for capital.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to InvArch](https://github.com/Invarchitect/InvArch/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
