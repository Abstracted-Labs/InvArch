## Intro

This repository should contains the Substrate FRAME Pallets used in the InvArch blockchain, and reviews their relationships and functions. At the current stage, the goal of creating this document and repository is centered around getting feedback while we continue to write the code and develop InvArch. This is a WIP.

## Overview

InvArch A Git Compatible IP Hosting, Management, & Cross-Chain Authentication Network for Web3

InvArch features the INV4 (Invention, Involvement, Inventory, Investment), OCIF (On-Chain Innovation Funding), & XCA (Cross-Chain Authentication) Protocols.

XCM features Cross-Consensus Messaging (XCM) to index, cross-reference, & certify IP asset authenticity across Web3 using various hashing methods & rounding algorithms.

## How to contribute

I'm really glad you're reading this, because we need volunteer developers to help this idea become a reality!

If you haven't already, come find us on the [#InvArch Discord](https://discord.gg/invarch). We want you working on things you're excited about!

### Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to InvArch](https://github.com/InvArch/InvArch/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    >
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.

Thank you,<br>
