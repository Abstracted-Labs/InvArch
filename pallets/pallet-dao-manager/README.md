# DAO Manager Pallet

## Introduction

The DAO Manager pallet is designed to manage advanced virtual multisigs, internally referred to as DAOs. It provides the functionality to create DAOs, mint and burn the DAO's voting tokens, and manage multisig proposals. This pallet is a comprehensive solution for decentralized decision-making processes, allowing for flexible and secure management of multisig operations.

## Features

- **DAO Creation**: Establish new DAOs with customizable parameters, including metadata, voting thresholds, and token freeze state.
- **Token Management**: Mint and burn the DAO's voting tokens to manage the voting power within the DAO.
- **Multisig Proposals**: Create, vote on, and cancel multisig proposals. Proposals automatically execute if they meet the execution threshold requirements.
- **Vote Management**: Members can vote on proposals, withdraw their votes, and influence the outcome of decisions.
- **Parameter Adjustment**: DAO parameters, such as voting thresholds and token freeze state, can be dynamically adjusted by DAO origins.

## Functionality Overview

### DAO Management

- `create_dao`: Initialize a new DAO with specific parameters and distribute initial voting tokens to the creator.
- `set_parameters`: Modify DAO parameters, including voting thresholds, metadata, and token freeze state.

### Token Operations

- `token_mint`: Mint the DAO's voting tokens to a specified target, increasing their voting power within the DAO.
- `token_burn`: Burn the DAO's voting tokens from a specified target, decreasing their voting power.

### Multisig Operations

- `operate_multisig`: Submit a new multisig proposal. If the proposal meets execution thresholds, it is automatically executed.
- `vote_multisig`: Cast a vote on an existing multisig proposal. Proposals execute automatically if they meet threshold requirements after the vote.
- `withdraw_vote_multisig`: Withdraw a previously cast vote from a multisig proposal.
- `cancel_multisig_proposal`: Cancel an existing multisig proposal. This action can only be performed by a DAO origin.

### Utility Functions

- `DaoAccountDerivation`: Derive consistent DAO AccountIds across parachains for seamless interaction.
- `DaoLookup`: Custom account lookup implementation for converting DaoIds to AccountIds.
- `FeeAsset`: Define the asset used by the multisig for paying transaction fees.
- `MultisigFeeHandler`: Manage fee payments for multisig operations, supporting both native and non-native assets.

## Usage

To utilize the DAO Manager pallet, users must first create a DAO and receive initial voting tokens. DAOs can propose actions, vote on proposals, and execute decisions based on the collective voting power of their members. The pallet's flexible design supports a wide range of multisig use cases, from simple governance decisions to complex, conditional executions.
